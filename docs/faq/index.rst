    Due to the length of the manual, only the most important content for most users is listed. If you have other needs, please contact the data center technicians.
    Important tips:
    
    1. Please do not run executable programs directly on the login node (it greatly affects the login and use efficiency of other users).
    2. If there is no special need, please submit tasks using batch processing (sbatch). If you have any questions, please contact the data center technicians.
    3. Please save the log file of the running program to facilitate the problem-solving assistance of the data center technicians when the job is out of order.
    4. If you need to run and debug programs on the calculation node, you can first allocate a dedicated calculation node, then ssh to the calculation node.
